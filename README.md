#Simple C++ Calculator
This program is just a simple calculator I made. It can add, subtract, multiply, and divide any two numbers you'd like. I might improve on this but right now, this is it lol

Code is an executable that can be used on any Unix system (I think) and Code.cpp is the actual source code.
